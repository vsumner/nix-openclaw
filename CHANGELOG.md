# Changelog

This changelog starts with the current pre-1.0 nix-openclaw Home Manager module
API transition.
Older repository history is available in git.

## 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Removed the retired OpenClaw QMD memory-backend integration and
  `programs.openclaw.qmd.prewarmModels` option. OpenClaw `2026.9.1` uses its
  builtin memory engine; local embeddings use the packaged `llama-cpp` runtime
  plugin and `memory.search.provider = "local"`.
- Kept `openclawPackages.qmd` as a standalone compatibility output for explicit
  external retrieval workflows. It is no longer injected automatically into
  the OpenClaw runtime.
- Corrected the Linux pnpm dependency hash for the pinned OpenClaw `2026.9.1`
  gateway source build.

## 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Updated the stable gateway and generated runtime plugin catalog to OpenClaw
  `2026.8.2`.
- Updated the source build to pnpm `12.2.1`, while retaining the pnpm 11
  lifecycle runner needed for deterministic offline rebuilds.

### Fixed

- Preserve pnpm 12 publication-time policy metadata in the fixed-output cache
  so source builds remain reproducible and do not wait on registry access.
- Seed Matrix SDK Crypto's platform-native binary from a fixed-output source so
  its postinstall remains offline on Linux and macOS.

## 2026-08-31

### Changed

- Updated the stable OpenClaw package to release `2026.8.1` (OpenClaw 2), built
  reproducibly from the pinned upstream source and pnpm lock.
- Materialized the ACPX and Codex runtime plugins from the same pinned OpenClaw
  workspace so their code and dependency graphs stay aligned with the gateway.
- Refreshed the generated runtime plugin catalog for OpenClaw `2026.8.1`.

### Fixed

- Allow immutable Nix store plugin roots through OpenClaw's ownership and
  hardlink checks, and recognize catalog-matched roots as trusted official
  installs in Nix mode.
- Keep explicit development source overrides labeled as unstable while release
  source builds retain the pinned OpenClaw release version.
- Build and run the gateway with Node 24 so OpenClaw's SQLite safety floor is
  preserved when nix-openclaw is consumed from older compatible nixpkgs pins.

## 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- Keep OpenClaw's private pnpm pins under `openclawPackages` so the default overlay no longer replaces Nixpkgs' pnpm for unrelated packages. Thanks @jerome-benoit (#116).
- `openclaw-reload` now restarts the configured Home Manager launchd labels or
  systemd user units instead of the old hardcoded `.nix` and `.nix-test`
  labels.

## 2026-06-06

### Changed

- Changed the stable `openclaw` / `openclaw-gateway` package path to build from
  upstream's published npm package and shrinkwrap by default. Source/pnpm builds
  remain available for explicit source overrides.
- Updated stable pin automation to refresh the npm wrapper lockfile and
  `gatewayNpmDepsHash` with each selected upstream source release.
- Replaced the vague CI aggregate with named supported-surface proofs for
  package artifacts, module render, source-override render, runtime smoke,
  platform activation, runtime plugin catalog/host behavior, and QMD opt-in.
- Removed the temporary dogfood package and check outputs from the public flake
  surface.

### Added

- Added `programs.openclaw.runtimePluginSources` for locked,
  Nix-reproducible npm and ClawHub runtime plugin artifacts. Generated
  supported ids still use `programs.openclaw.runtimePlugins`.
- Added shrinkwrap materialization for runtime plugins with npm dependencies.
  Shrinkwrapped packages use `npmDepsHash`; plugins that bundle `node_modules`
  remain supported.
- Added `runtimePlugins` support for `acpx`, `codex`, `copilot`, `matrix`,
  `memory-lancedb`, `tlon`, and `whatsapp`.

## 2026-06-05

### Highlights

- The nix-openclaw Home Manager module now manages OpenClaw workspace bootstrap
  files explicitly instead of reading a single `programs.openclaw.documents`
  directory.
- Baseline: packaged upstream OpenClaw `v2026.6.1`
  (`2e08f0f4221f522b60423ed6ffd83427942b28de`).
- Scope: this entry describes the nix-openclaw module/API migration only; it
  does not claim later upstream OpenClaw tags or `main`.

### Trace

- nix-openclaw implementation commit:
  `85ac5a06bc00a0bc48c8e9831979e5e8b13184ce`
- Date written: 2026-06-05
- Packaged upstream OpenClaw release:
  `v2026.6.1` (`2e08f0f4221f522b60423ed6ffd83427942b28de`)

### Breaking Changes

#### nix-openclaw Shortcut Config Options Were Removed

nix-openclaw no longer has separate Home Manager shortcut options for provider,
channel, routing, or agent config. Put OpenClaw runtime config under
`programs.openclaw.config` and `programs.openclaw.instances.<name>.config`,
using the upstream OpenClaw config shape.

This is a nix-openclaw module API break, not an upstream OpenClaw runtime parser
change.

This entry is included because this changelog is the migration ledger for
current nix-openclaw Home Manager module breaks. The shortcut-option removal is
not caused by the workspace-file change, but users and agents upgrading
pre-1.0 nix-openclaw need one place to see every required config rewrite.

Before:

```nix
programs.openclaw = {
  providers.telegram = {
    enable = true;
    botTokenFile = "/run/agenix/telegram-bot-token";
    allowFrom = [ 12345678 ];
  };

  providers.anthropic.apiKeyFile = "/run/agenix/anthropic-api-key";
};
```

After:

```nix
programs.openclaw = {
  environment.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "/run/agenix/anthropic-api-key";

  config = {
    channels.telegram = {
      tokenFile = "/run/agenix/telegram-bot-token";
      allowFrom = [ 12345678 ];
    };

    models.providers.anthropic.apiKey = {
      source = "env";
      provider = "default";
      id = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY";
    };
  };
};
```

For named instances, put per-instance OpenClaw config under the instance.
Top-level `programs.openclaw.config` is merged into every instance; instance
config is the boundary for prod/test routing, credentials, and host-specific
runtime settings:

```nix
programs.openclaw.instances.prod.config.channels.telegram = {
  tokenFile = "/run/agenix/telegram-prod";
  allowFrom = [ 12345678 ];
};
```

#### `programs.openclaw.documents` Is Removed

`programs.openclaw.documents` is removed and now fails evaluation. Replace it
with explicit workspace bootstrap files and extra managed workspace files.

The old option hid the ownership contract. One directory mixed upstream
bootstrap context with arbitrary companion files, and other Nix modules could
also write directly into the same workspace-like paths. That made deploy-time
clobbering hard to reason about: the file owner depended on activation order and
on whether a file happened to be copied through `documents` or written somewhere
else. The new API is deliberately explicit so each Nix-managed workspace target
has one declaration.

Before:

```nix
programs.openclaw.documents = ./documents;
```

The old directory commonly looked like this:

```text
documents/
|-- AGENTS.md
|-- SOUL.md
|-- TOOLS.md
|-- IDENTITY.md
|-- USER.md
|-- LORE.md
|-- PROMPTING-EXAMPLES.md
`-- HEARTBEAT.md
```

After:

```nix
programs.openclaw.workspace.bootstrapFiles = {
  agents = ./workspace/AGENTS.md;
  soul = ./workspace/SOUL.md;
  tools = ./workspace/TOOLS.md;
  identity = ./workspace/IDENTITY.md;
  user = ./workspace/USER.md;

  # Set a path only if HEARTBEAT.md should be Nix-managed.
  heartbeat = null;
};

programs.openclaw.workspace.files = {
  "LORE.md" = ./workspace/LORE.md;
  "PROMPTING-EXAMPLES.md" = ./workspace/PROMPTING-EXAMPLES.md;
};
```

File mapping:

| Old file | New declaration |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | `workspace.bootstrapFiles.agents` |
| `SOUL.md` | `workspace.bootstrapFiles.soul` |
| `TOOLS.md` | `workspace.bootstrapFiles.tools` |
| `IDENTITY.md` | `workspace.bootstrapFiles.identity` |
| `USER.md` | `workspace.bootstrapFiles.user` |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | `workspace.bootstrapFiles.heartbeat` if Nix-managed |
| `LORE.md` | `workspace.files."LORE.md"` if Nix-managed |
| `PROMPTING-EXAMPLES.md` | `workspace.files."PROMPTING-EXAMPLES.md"` if Nix-managed |
| other companion docs | `workspace.files."<target path>"` if Nix-managed |
| `BOOTSTRAP.md` | runtime-owned; do not declare |
| `MEMORY.md` | runtime-owned; do not declare |
| `memory/` | runtime-owned; do not declare |

The old `documents` option required only `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, and
`TOOLS.md`. The new `workspace.bootstrapFiles` option requires `AGENTS.md`,
`SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, and `USER.md` when bootstrap files are
enabled.

Files from the old `documents` directory that are not re-declared under
`workspace.bootstrapFiles` or `workspace.files` intentionally stop being
managed by nix-openclaw.

#### OpenClaw Bootstrap Seeding Is Disabled For Nix-Managed Workspaces

When `workspace.bootstrapFiles` is set, nix-openclaw forces
`agents.defaults.skipBootstrap = true`. Config that tries to set it to `false`
now fails evaluation.

Before:

```nix
programs.openclaw.config.agents.defaults.skipBootstrap = false;
```

After:

```nix
# Omit this setting. nix-openclaw sets it to true when workspace bootstrap files
# are Nix-managed.
```

This prevents upstream OpenClaw from creating missing bootstrap files from
bundled templates in a declarative install. If runtime bootstrap seeding stayed
enabled, OpenClaw could create missing files such as `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, or
`USER.md` during first run, then a later Nix activation could replace some of
those files while leaving other runtime-created files behind. That recreates the
same unclear ownership model this migration removes.

#### Workspace File Ownership Is Explicit

`workspace.files` manages only extra files below the workspace. It rejects:

- bootstrap file targets such as `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`,
  `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, and `HEARTBEAT.md`
- runtime-owned targets such as `BOOTSTRAP.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `memory`, and
  `memory/...`
- absolute paths, parent-directory escapes, empty path segments, `.` or `..`
  path segments, trailing slashes, tabs, and newlines

If a deployment had separate `home.file` writers for files inside the same
OpenClaw workspace, migrate those files into `workspace.bootstrapFiles` or
`workspace.files` so there is one declarative owner.

Public and private modules can split ownership field-by-field. This lets a
public nix repo publish reusable default context while a private nix repo adds
`USER.md`, host-specific identity, or private companion files without copying
the public module or leaking private context:

```nix
# Public module.
programs.openclaw.workspace.bootstrapFiles = {
  agents = ./workspace/AGENTS.md;
  soul = ./workspace/SOUL.md;
  tools = ./workspace/TOOLS.md;
  identity = ./workspace/IDENTITY.md;
};

programs.openclaw.workspace.files."LORE.md" = ./workspace/LORE.md;

# Private module.
programs.openclaw.workspace.bootstrapFiles.user = ./workspace/USER.md;
```
