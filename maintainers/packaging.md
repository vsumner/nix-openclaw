# Packaging Invariants

This repo ships a working Nix package for OpenClaw users, not just a pin mirror.

## Product Surface

- The user-facing package is `openclaw`.
- `openclaw-gateway` is the runnable gateway for Linux and macOS. Stable pins
  use upstream's npm package/shrinkwrap by default; source builds remain for
  explicit source overrides.
- `openclaw-app` is the Darwin-only desktop app from upstream's public app artifact.
- Component outputs exist for modules, checks, and debugging. They are not separate product tracks.
- Do not add dogfood package tracks. If maintainers need to test an unreleased
  upstream source, use an explicit source override instead of adding another
  public flake output.
- Do not split the repo into separate desktop and server tracks.

## Nix Ownership

- OpenClaw owns product and runtime behavior.
- `nix-openclaw` owns batteries-included Nix packaging, Home Manager/NixOS/Darwin modules, runtime PATH/env injection, launchd/systemd wiring, and package-contract checks.
- `nix-openclaw-tools` owns packaging OpenClaw-adjacent CLI tools and plugin metadata. Consume it here; do not duplicate its package definitions here.
- Downstream system repos should only choose hosts, secrets, accounts, and enabled plugins. If downstream needs bespoke scripts to make a plugin or harness work, prefer fixing this repo or `nix-openclaw-tools`.
- Nix mode means Nix owns `openclaw.json`.
- Runtime config mutation belongs upstream in OpenClaw. Downstream patches here must be small, temporary, and removed after the pinned upstream release contains the fix.
- Generated config options come from the upstream core schema.
- Plugin-owned extension surfaces, such as `channels.<plugin-id>`, must remain accepted by the Home Manager module even when core does not type every plugin key.
- Runtime tool injection belongs here. If a plugin or battery is enabled, the active OpenClaw harness must see its CLI tools and required environment without asking downstream to expose those tools globally on the user PATH.
- OpenClaw plugin roots belong here too. The Home Manager module consumes `openclawPlugin.plugins` declarations from plugin flakes and writes `plugins.load.paths` plus default `plugins.entries.<id>.enabled` values into the generated config.
- Raw npm/ClawHub plugin names are not batteries-included deployment config. Curated plugins packaged here must be exposed through packages/checks so CI/Garnix caches them. Arbitrary user specs need a deterministic lock/hash-backed Nix builder so Nix reuses the user's store/cache and only rebuilds when the spec, lock, or hash changes.

## Build Contract

- The gateway package must include Control UI assets.
- No inline scripts or inline file contents in Nix code. Use repo scripts and explicit file paths.
- Keep runtime tools internal to the `openclaw` wrapper unless they are intentionally part of the public package surface.
- OpenClaw 2026.9.1 and newer use the builtin memory engine. Do not inject QMD into the gateway runtime or restore the retired `memory.backend` configuration.
- Keep the standalone `qmd` package output available for explicit downstream retrieval workflows until that compatibility surface is retired separately.
- ACPX compatibility files are staged at build time from locked package inputs,
  not installed or repaired by npm at runtime.
- Keep files under 400 lines unless a maintainer explicitly accepts the larger file.

## Investigations

### External QMD workflows

- QMD is not an OpenClaw memory backend after 2026.9.1.
- Downstream tools may consume `openclawPackages.qmd` explicitly, but it is not added to the gateway runtime unless a user includes it in `runtimePackages`.
- OpenClaw local embeddings use the official `llama-cpp` runtime plugin and `memory.search.provider = "local"`.
